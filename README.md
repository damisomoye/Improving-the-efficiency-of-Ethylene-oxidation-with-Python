# Optimizing-Ethylene-oxidation-with-Python
The chemical plant is described a a first-principle nonlinear dynamic model, implemented as a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

The Nonlinear Model Predictive controller performs real-time optimization in order to determine the most effective way to control the system in order to ensure optimum outut from the plant

The result of the nonlinear MPC shows good reference tracking and disturbance rejection performance, as expected
